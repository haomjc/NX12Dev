基于NXOpen的模型构建
NX是siemens UGS PLM开发，支持从CAID、CAD、CAE到CAM的完整生命周期管理软件。作为机械结构设计的软件巨头之一，NX提供的辅助开发工具及接口已能促进模型的便利化构建，模型库构建通常采用NX表达式建模法、自定义特征命令法、电子表格模板驱动法和参数化程序驱动设计法。其中程序驱动法采用NX Open API编写模型的参数化驱动命令，其编程难度较大，且开发周期较长，但可根据用户需求定制，应用层次最接近底层，用户界面最友好。通过综合比较分析，选用参数化程序驱动设计法的方案进行系统开发，实现RV减速器模型构建。

Model building based on NXOpen
NX is developed by siemens UGS PLM and supports the complete lifecycle management software from CAID, CAD, CAE to CAM. As one of the software giants for mechanical structure design, NX provides auxiliary development tools and interfaces that have facilitated model construction. Model library construction usually uses NX expression modeling method, custom feature command method, spreadsheet template driven method, and parametric program driven design method. Among them, the program-driven method uses NX Open API to write parametric drive commands for models, which is more difficult to program and has a longer development cycle, but can be customized according to user requirements, with the application level closest to the bottom and the most user-friendly interface. Through comprehensive comparison and analysis, the solution of parametric program-driven design method was selected for system development to realize the RV reducer model construction.
